# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied consistently across a React application.  The issue appears to be intermittent, affecting some components while others render correctly with the same classes.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to elements.  The syntax appears correct and the Tailwind configuration is valid. The problem is not consistent and appears to be related to component mounting or rendering order. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Observe the rendered output â€“ the red box should display correctly. If it does not, check the browser console for errors.

## Solution

The solution provided addresses this issue. It involves reviewing component lifecycle methods and ensures the classes are applied after the component fully renders, possibly due to asynchronous operations impacting the timing of the Tailwind class application.
